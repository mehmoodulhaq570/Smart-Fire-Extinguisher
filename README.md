## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Fire Detection**  
   - Camera captures video and feeds it to the YOLOv9 model for fire detection.  
   - Smoke sensors provide complementary input for early warning.  

2. **Coordinate Mapping**  
   - YOLOv9 identifies the fire's location and maps it to real-world coordinates.  

3. **Targeted Suppression**  
   - The microcontroller processes the coordinates and directs the servo motor.  
   - Water is sprayed precisely on the fire.  

4. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   - Ensures the fire is extinguished and adjusts the nozzle position if needed.
